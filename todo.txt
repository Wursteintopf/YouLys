TODOS:

• Stop tracking and exlude inactive channels
• Add logging to check amount of API Calls for better optimization
• Add dynamic tracking, track new videos more frequent as old ones
• Probably add more channels
• Dynamic Changes in video- and channel statistic -> if Data didnt change, there is no need to save it multiple times
